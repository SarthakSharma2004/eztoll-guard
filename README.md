#                   🚧 EZTollGuard: FASTag Fraud Detection

---


#           🧠 Overview

* With the rise of digital toll collection via FASTag, toll operators face increasing fraud cases including:

* Vehicle misclassification

* Lane misuse

* Underpayment

* Speed bypassing

* These issues lead to revenue loss and operational inefficiency at toll plazas.

---


#          🎯 Objective


* To develop a machine learning model that detects potential FASTag fraud in by analyzing:

- Transaction data

- Vehicle data

- Vehicle patterns , dimensions

- Enabling toll operators to reduce revenue leakage and improve toll security.



#           🛠️ Tools & Libraries


* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pipeline)

* Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization


---

#           🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


* Analyzed transaction amounts, vehicle classes, lane IDs etc.

* Identified patterns in frequent underpayment, suspicious vehicle classes, and speed bypassing.

* Visualized fraud-prone patterns across time of day, vehicle types, and specific lanes.



#           🚀 Business Impact

* ✅ Enables real-time fraud detection at FASTag toll booths.
* ✅ Reduces revenue leakage for toll operators.
* ✅ Improves operational efficiency and security at toll plazas.
